# Hand transformers

This repository contains various experiments,
some of which are to create a subject for a hackathon,
some others are directed to find interesting structures in small transformers.

## Hackathon

A potential subject for the hackathon is [`hackathon.ipynb`](./hackathon.ipynb),
suported by the library [`hand.py`](./hand.py). `hand.py` implements the model of
the transformer we use, the framework for the exercices, tests and utilities
